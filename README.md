# Insurance Cost Prediction

The rise in healthcare costs has significantly impacted insurance premiums, making it essential to understand the factors that contribute to these costs. This project aims to analyze and predict insurance costs based on various health and demographic factors.

## Purpose:
To determine the key factors influencing insurance costs and develop a predictive model through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning techniques.

## Tools and Libraries:
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning modeling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization

## Project Workflow:

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Gain insights from the dataset by analyzing distributions, relationships, and patterns.
- Identify significant variables affecting insurance costs.

### 2. Data Preprocessing and Engineering:
- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Encode categorical variables.
- Normalize and scale numerical features.
- Perform feature engineering to create new relevant features.

### 3. Model Building:

- **Initial Modeling**: Start with simple models like Linear Regression to set a baseline.

- **Advanced Modeling**: Implement complex models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

- **Regularization Techniques**: Apply Ridge and LASSO to handle multicollinearity and improve model robustness.

- **Ensemble Methods**: Use Bagging, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting for better predictions.

### 4. Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate models using metrics like **RMSE** (Root Mean Square Error), **RÂ²** (Coefficient of Determination), **MAE** (Mean Absolute Error), and **accuracy**.
- Compare performance across different models and select the best one.

### 5. Model Tuning:
- Optimize hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Validate models using cross-validation techniques.

### 6. Final Interpretation and Recommendations:
- Interpret the results to provide actionable insights.
- Recommend strategies for optimizing insurance costs based on model findings.
